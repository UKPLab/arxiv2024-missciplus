protein which facilitates tenofovir efflux from proximal tubular cells, may be more prone to tenofovir toxicity.[29] Furthermore, inhibition of tenofovir entry into proximal tubular cells via the organic anion transporter by probenecid prevents recurrent tenofovir renal toxicity.[30] Consistent with this proposed mechanism of drug accumulation in the renal proximal tubule, most case reports describe tenofovir renal toxicity presenting as partial or full Fanconi syndrome characterized by sub-nephrotic proteinuria with or without hyperphosphaturia and normoglycemic glycosuria.[31-33]
